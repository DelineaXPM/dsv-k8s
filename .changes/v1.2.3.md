## v1.2.3 - 2024-08-12


### ðŸ¤– CI & Build

- Add a buildName metadata to binary so easy to see if caching issue with container loading. Handle `dev.local/dsv-k8s` as standard image name to better reflect standard approach I've been using. Improve validation checks. Goreleaser upgrade schema and more. Lots of quality of life improvements for dev, and aqua updates.

### ðŸ”¨ Refactor

- Improve `values.yml` for the dsv-injector to expose the days till expiration of the self signed cert.
Include minor doc improvements to this as well to better handle.
