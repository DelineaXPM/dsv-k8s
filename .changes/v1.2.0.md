## v1.2.0 - 2023-04-27

### ðŸ¤– CI & Build

- Improve mage tasks for minikube, including list images, remove/load images.
- Update aqua to the latest version.
- Include aqua configuration tags for Github actions.
- Pin the version examples in the chart install and yaml values file as a better practice for production chart usage.
- Chart versions no longer are independently versioned.
  Instead the docker image, syncing chart, and injector chart are all aligned with the same version number.
  This is automatically kept to the correct version when running `changie merge`.

### ðŸ”¨ Refactor

- Improve output to structured json logs.
- Change invocation to use environment variable configuration.
- Allow users to provide config maps dynamically in Values.yaml.
- Note the current version, commit sha, and date of the currently used binary at startup.

- Ensure default timeout is set for `ReadHeaderTimeout`.

### ðŸ¤– Development

- Improve the local development experience with Tilt.
- Improve documentation and include stern/kubectl log to file snippets.
- Add local development checks for values files.
  This will catch incorrectly configured values that are difficult to troubleshoot in local development workflows.
- Add missing `--overwrite` tag to `mage minikube:loadimages` task.
