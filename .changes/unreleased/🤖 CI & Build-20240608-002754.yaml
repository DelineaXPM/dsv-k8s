kind: "\U0001F916 CI & Build"
body: Add a buildName metadata to binary so easy to see if caching issue with container loading. Handle `dev.local/dsv-k8s` as standard image name to better reflect standard approach I've been using. Improve validation checks. Goreleaser upgrade schema and more. Lots of quality of life improvements for dev, and aqua updates.
