## v1.1.5 - 2023-01-24

### 🔨 Refactor

- Point the helm charts towards docker hub based images, instead of quay, as these are now iterated on with changelog driven release instead of each commit.
  This should reduce frequency of needless version updates.

### 🐛 Bug Fix

- Docker Hub published images did not have the correct path to the injector and syncer, resulting in an invalid entrypoint.
  This is fixed and should now correctly resolve when using the updated helm charts that provide a qualified path.
  For example: `/app/dsv-injector` instead of just saying `dsv-injector` now.
  This is due to using a minimal distroless image and not copying binaries into a path that is assumed to be resolved automatically by `PATH`, such as `/usr/local/bin`.
  Now the path to the binary is explicitly set and should resolve any path resolution issues.

### 🤖 Development

- Bump aqua tooling and include dsv-cli in the project setup.
- Included `CGO_ENABLED=0` to avoid issues with running commands in devcontainers & codespaces.
- Improved mage tasks to support minikube as default to see if this helps with Codespace timeouts being experienced.
- Bumped the docker feature kit to 2.0 as well to attempt to resolve timeouts in devcontainer/codespaces.
