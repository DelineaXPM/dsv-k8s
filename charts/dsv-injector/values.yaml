service:

  port: 8543

  # -- ClusterIP is typical when the webhook is running as a POD
  # However, it can also be hosted externally, which is useful for debugging, by providing the following instead:
  #   type: ExternalName
  # externalName: my.fqdn
  # So long as:
  # - my.fqdn hosts an HTTPS endpoint on port {webhookPort} that answers URI {webhookUri}
  # - the certificate must have a Subject Alternative Name for {name}.{namespace}.{svc}, e.g., dsv-injector.dsv.svc
  # - the caBundle must be a base64 string containing a PEM-encoded certificate chain that validates the certifcate
  # caBundle: ...
  type: ClusterIP

# -- We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious
# choice for the user. This also increases chances charts run on environments with little
# resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to specify resources, uncomment the following
# lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.
# @default -- No default values, user must specify to set resource limits.

#   cpu: 100m

# -- webhookScope specifies which resources are in scope, "Cluster", "Namespaced" or "*"
# @default -- "Namespaced"
webhookScope: Namespaced
# -- containerPort is the port that the container itself listens on
containerPort: 18543

# -- configmap are configuration values for the app to load.
# All of these are defaulted in the template itself and only need be set if adjusting.
