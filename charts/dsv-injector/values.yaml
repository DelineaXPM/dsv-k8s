# ClusterIP is typical when the webhook is running as a POD
  type: ClusterIP
# However, it can also be hosted externally, which is useful for debugging, by providing the following instead:
# type: ExternalName
#externalName: my.fqdn
# So long as:
# 1) my.fqdn hosts an HTTPS endpoint on port {webhookPort} that answers URI {webhookUri}
# 2) the certificate must have a Subject Alternative Name for {name}.{namespace}.{svc}, e.g., dsv-injector.dsv.svc
# 3) the caBundle must be a base64 string containing a PEM-encoded certificate chain that validates the certifcate

  # We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious
  # choice for the user. This also increases chances charts run on environments with little
  # resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to specify resources, uncomment the following
  # lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.
